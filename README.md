## Introduction

This is a fun little project I wanted to make.


### What does it do?

I was trying to come up with a "Pok√©mon" region of my own. I wanted to manage about 100 Pok√©mon from the list of 1000. I made a tool that helped me edit properties that I have defined myself. This tool also helps me filter based on these properties while running the whole project with a single command. used concurrently for it üò≠üò≠

### Project Details

It takes a collection of Pok√©mon data in the form of JSON (JSON is in the backend).
